This is the repository for the My Dairy Farm app. It is a work in progress 🚧.

My Dairy Farm is a fully functional Android app built entirely with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.
It follows Android design and development best practices and is intended to be a great aid to all 
small scale, medium scale, and large scale Dairy Farmers, in managing their dairy farms by keeping 
track of their cows, including their breeding records, milk records, and other relevant information.
